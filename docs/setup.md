## Prerequisites

  * Compiler that supports C++11 or newer (gcc, clang, etc)
  * A corresponding version of CMake
    - For C++11 and C++14, v3.1 or newer
    - For C++17, v3.8 or newer
  * POSIX threading library (pthread)

## Setup

This repo is designed for an out-of-tree build. This makes it easier to switch
between compilers should this be required.
